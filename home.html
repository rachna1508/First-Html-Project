                <p>A goal is a thought of things to come or wanted outcome that an individual or a gathering of individuals imagine, 
                    plan and focus on achieve.People try to arrive at goals inside a limited time by setting cutoff times. 
                    A goal is generally like a reason or point, the foreseen outcome which guides response, or an end, which is an 
                    article, either a physical item or a theoretical article, that has inherent worth.
                </p>
                <p>We all want to be happy. But we sometimes think of happiness as a thing that happens to us â€” something we have no control over. 
                    It's easy to link the idea of happiness with the situation we're in. We might tell ourselves, "If only things were different, then I'd be happy."
                    But that's not really how happiness works. Research shows that just a small portion of happiness (only about 10%) depends on a person's situation. So where does most of our happiness come from?
                    Researchers have found that more than half of happiness depends on things that are actually under our control. That's really good news because it means everyone can be happier.
                    A big part of how happy we are depends on our mindset, the habits we practice, and the way we live each day. By learning the key ingredients of happiness, we can use them to become happier.
                    So keep yourself happy and keep smile always on your face. This is a kind of ornament that all of us are having to show.

                <p>Among all the creatures on Earth, human being is definitely superior. Writing a few lines or words about myself to introduce, I feel myself to be tiny part of this entire world that is filled with the human beings around.I myself am humble, kind, caring and courageous.
                My father is a a govt. employee who knows how to love his profession with passion and dedication while my mother is a clerk and a housewife who knows how to handle both her jobs.</p>
                <p>Therefore, writing about myself, I m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life is the total manifestation of what I do today. I try myself to be humble, passionate, dedicated, hardworking and honest.
                I deem my parents as being my best mentors. I have learnt the real meaning and worth of life from my parents. I am with a happy, focused and hardworking family. That is definitely the greatest blessing of God for me.</p>
